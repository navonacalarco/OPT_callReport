>We are currently in month `r targets[targets$month == as.character(substr(Sys.Date(), 1, 7)), 'month_count']` of the study.  

This report is meant to provide a quick overview of the OPTIMUM-Neuro study, to facilitate discussion on its bi-weekly conference calls. All data summarized here derives from the 'tracking' arm of the WashU REDCap database (arm 6), and thus is only as accurate as the data captured there.
