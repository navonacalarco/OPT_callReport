# OPT_callReport
This script produces the bi-weekly study report for the OPTIMUM-Neuro conference call (example report at http://rpubs.com/navona/OPT-Neuro_2018-05-17).

I have yet to automate the REDCap data pull via API - will do that soon. For now, the script requires two separate data csvs: one containing data from the MRI form in arm 6 baseline, and the other contaning all of the arm 6 baseline data with the exception of the MRI form.
